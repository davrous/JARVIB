Here is an adaptive card template for showing a list of models with their name and associated image:

{
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "version": "1.3",
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "body": [
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Available models",
            "weight": "bolder",
            "size": "large"
        },
        {
            "type": "Container",
            "items": [
                {
                    "type": "TextBlock",
                    "text": "* Item X"
                },
                {
                    "type": "Image",
                    "url": "* Url Y",
                    "width": "100px",
                    "horizontalAlignment": "left"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

Here's a list of model's names and associated images URL. This array contains a list items names:

{{$list}}

While this array lists the associated 1:1 mapping of the image URL:

{{$imageList}}

Here's the users query:

```
{{$input}}
```

Use the template to create an adaptive card and uses both arrays to populate the fields. You need to create a list with several items.
Take into account any changes asked for by the user.
Always replace the placeholder text, Item X, and Url Y with real data.
